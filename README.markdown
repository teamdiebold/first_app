# This is my first attempt at designing a ruby application

Some resources to aid me in designing Ruby on Rails:

[*Ruby Gems*](http://rubygems.org)[: a Ruby gem is a package. It contains the necessary files and information for being installed on the system. Quoting RubyGems, «a gem is a packaged Ruby application or library. It has a name (e.g. rake) and a version (e.g. 0.4.16)».

Being very powerful, gems are of great importance in the Rubyland. They can easily be used to extend or modify functionality within Ruby applications.]

[*Ruby on Rails*](http://rubyonrails.org)[: Ruby on Rails is not to be confused with Ruby, which is a general-purpose programming language, on which Ruby on Rails runs. Ruby itself existed for more than 10 years before the first release of Ruby on Rails. Rails is a full-stack framework, meaning that it gives the Web developer the full ability to gather information from the web server, talking to or querying the database, and template rendering out of the box. As a result, Rails features a routing system that is independent of the Web server.]

[*GitHub*](https://github.com/)[: a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. GitHub offers both commercial plans and free accounts for open source projects. According to the Git User's Survey in 2009, GitHub is the most popular Git hosting site.]

[*heroku*](http://heroku)[: a cloud application platform – a new way of building and deploying web apps.]

[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book)[: An online RoR tutorial book]

[*RoR Cheat Sheet*](http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/ruby-on-rails-cheat-sheet/)[: A quick reference guide for Ruby on Rails, containing the default directory structure, predefined variables, methods, reserved words and regular expression syntax.]

[*YouTube*](http://youtube.com)[: Great place to go to get video tutorials.  You will need to pay attention to the versions being used on the video and adapt to it.]
